            <p> Although Jeevan was born in Squamish, BC, he lived most his life in Surrey, BC. 
                He enjoys playing most sports, and his interest in computing has led him to enroll in the CST program at BCIT. He hopes to 
				graduate with his diploma in 2019, and possibly a bachelor's degree within a few years.				</p>
